# ez-yt-dlp

This project, because I am tired of scratching wiki for an argument to pass when downloading videos/audios using [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp "yt-dlp"), tired of typing same flags over and over again, etc. But, why not aliases? Because, I can't afford to update my `.bash_aliases` everytime I change my OS. And, at the end, to feel like I've helped a non tech-savvy friend.

## Installation Instruction
- Download the script to your $HOME/bin directory (make sure it exists): 
`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/diggajupadhyay/ez-yt-dlp/main/ez-yt-dlp.sh -P $HOME/bin`
- Make it executable:
`chmod +x $HOME/bin/ez-yt-dlp.sh`
- Now, try downloading a video!
`ez-yt-dlp.sh https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xL3qxz1WjzQ`

### Quick Tip: 
Try to hit [TAB] button in your keyboard as you type the name "ez-" and it should auto-complete at some point so you don't have to type in the whole thing. See: https://www.gnu.org/software/gnuastro/manual/html_node/Bash-TAB-completion-tutorial.html
